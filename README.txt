This is my diploma about cellular automata in cryptography.
Build is on Maven.
JDK : 1.8 (using JavaFX)

I support now:
Plain (regular) automata : with N inputs to one output
Block automata : with input and output to some group of elemets
Trivial automata: doesn't change anything

Straight Cypher : only pass data through CA
(Cyphers support I/O, from input file to output file block per block)

UI is on .fxml
